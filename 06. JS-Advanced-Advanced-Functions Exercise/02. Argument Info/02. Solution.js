// Write a function that displays information about the arguments which are passed to it 
// (type and value) and a summary about the number of each type in the following format: 
// `{argument type}: {argument value}`
// Print each argument description on a new line. At the end print a tally with counts for each type in descending order, each on a new line in the following format:
// `{type} = {count}`
// If two types have the same count, use order of appearance. 
// Do NOT print anything for types that do not appear in the list of arguments.
// Input
// You will receive a series of arguments passed to your function.
// Output
// Print on the console the type and value of each argument passed into your function.
