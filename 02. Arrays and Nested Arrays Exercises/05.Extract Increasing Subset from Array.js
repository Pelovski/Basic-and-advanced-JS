// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subset. 
//In other words, you start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. 
//Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored,
// alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest one 
//and you continue to the next number. 
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subset. Return the array of numbers.
